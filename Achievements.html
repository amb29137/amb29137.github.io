		<h3 style="text-align:center">Welcome to Alex Browning's Blog</h3>
		<p>Throughout this webpage you will see a showcase of my computer science knowledge as well as recieving an added bonus of learning about who I am outside of the classroom!</p>

<div id="Who Am I?" class="tabcontent">
		<h3 style="text-align:center">Who Am I?</h3>
		<p>I am a freshman at UGA who is currently on the brink of losing hope and dropping out of college.  But, on the bright side I have a nice stack of student loans to show for it.  I guess that's what I get for being the lazy boy I was all the past year.  In reality I am probably not much different that you, whoever you are. I eat, I sleep, and I breathe just like you do.  I feel pain and I know dissapointment.  These day's its been one after another and I feel like Alice falling down the rabbit hole.</p>
	</div>

<div id="Achievements" class="tabcontent">
		<h3 style="text-align:center">Achievements</h3>
		<p>I got an A once.</p>
		<p>In all seriousness I was Drum Captain of the Marching Band in highschool, I was a member of the UGA Rowing Team, and I currently work 20 to 30 hours a week at the Jittery Joe's MLC.  And yes that is an accomplishment because I still manage to get my stuff done and make it to this class.</p>
	</div>

<div id="Goals" class="tabcontent">
		<h3 style="text-align:center">Goals</h3>
		<p>If Im being honest this whole thing is an attempt for me to beg you to give me an A in the class.  I need all the help I can get in this long treck to gaining H.O.P.E. back.</p>
	</div>

<div id="Travel" class="tabcontent">
		<h3 style="text-align:center">Travel</h3>
		<p> Im going to Disney World the week after finals so that has to count for something?  Im also taking my girlfriend on a super date which will consist of attending the High Museum of Art, the renound restaurant Cafe Intermezzo, be in the presence of Sutton Foster at the Fox theater, play a round of laser tag and end the night at the hotel room I have booked for the two of us.</p>
